# Warzone-Project
This is a simple “Risk” computer game made for a Concordia C++ class. 

A Warzone game setup consists of a connected graph
map representing a world map, where each node is a country and each edge represents adjacency between
countries. Two or more players can play by placing armies on countries they own, from which they can attack
adjacent countries to conquer them. The objective of the game is to conquer all countries on the map.
